# Sentiment-Analysis-Project-Using-BERT-
I have finetuned BERT model to classify the given sentence in to one of the three catagories: postitive, negative , neatural
where in the final layer: -1:negative 
                           0: neutral
                           1: postitive
                           
This code will call BERT model  and finetune it after pre-processing given data.
To run this code enter the followig command in the terminal: sh bert_fineture.sh

I have used already existing detasets
